              is sufficiently probable that quantitative scansion in Latin, imposed on a language in which accentuation by stress was alone significant originally, not only gave way to the earlier principle in the decline of Latin literature, but scarcely tended to suppress it at any time in common speech and in familiar writing. It is also probable therefore that even in literature dominated by quantity stress-accentuation was not obliterated altogether. In fact the incidences of it, in Vergilian verse at least, seemed so characteristic that in late Antiquity the Vergilian stress-rhythms were apparently copied without any knowledge of the prosody of the hexameter. In modern expositions, the variety of Vergil's rhythms is generally referred, not only to scansion, but also to stress-accentuation: and it has recently been shown that lines in which stress and metrical ictus predominantly coincide are different in quality and expressiveness from lines in which they do not. Since however no general explanation or definition of this difference in quality seemed to have been offered, I lately attempted a simple theory which would account for the different aesthetic values of lines of these two classes, and which would define, if possible, what these different values are.},

Cross-validation results are reported for each method, and each method is further employed in classifying the disputed papers and the few papers that are generally understood to be coauthored. These tests are performed using two separate feature sets: a ‘‘raw’’ feature set containing all words and word bigrams that are common to all of the authors, and a second ‘‘pre-processed’’ feature set derived by reducing the raw feature set to include only words meeting a minimum relative frequency threshold. Each of the methods tested performed well, but nearest shrunken centroids and regularized discriminant analysis had the best overall performances with 0/70 cross-validation errors.},

This method characterizes documents by a set of word sequences that combine functional and content words. The experimental results on poem classification demonstrated that this method outperforms most current state-of-the-art approaches, and that it is appropriate to handle the attribution of short documents.},

B 32 (1970) 350; Biometrics 26 (1970) 23)), generates distributions of differences in goodness-of-ﬁt expected under each of the competing models. In the data informed version of the PBCM, the generating models have speciﬁc parameter values obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data under consideration. The data informed difference distributions can be compared to the observed difference in goodness-of-ﬁt to allow a quantiﬁcation of model adequacy. In the data uninformed version of the PBCM, the generating models have a relatively broad range of parameter values based on prior knowledge. Application of both the data informed and the data uninformed PBCM is illustrated with several examples.},

Although poetry is a literary form that makes use standardmeters usually repeated among different authors, we will see in this paper howperforming such analyses is a difficult task in machine learning due to theunexpected deviations from such standard patterns. After breaking down someexamples of classical poetry, we apply a number of NLP techniques for thescansion of poetry, training and testing our systems against a human-annotatedcorpus. With these experiments, our purpose is establish a baseline ofautomatic scansion of poetry using NLP tools in a straightforward manner and toraise awareness of the difficulties of this task.},

	abstract = {Poetry is a form of art that is used to express emotions and feelings. Humans can easily distinguish poetry without any sophisticated tools. This study is concerned with developing intelligent methods which can be used to distinguish poem from prose. The goal is to distinguish and extract effective poetic features with which poems/lyrics can be accurately classified from other type of texts. In this paper, we propose five different approaches to poem classification. In each approach, we extracted a different set of poetic features and evaluated their performances against each other. In addition, we empirically assessed the effectiveness of traditional text classification methods for poem recognition and compared it with the proposed poetic features. While all of these approaches performed well, some showed superior results. Findings of this study suggest that the proposed features generate highly accurate classifiers, which can be used for poem mining in large databases such as World Wide Web. 1.},

	abstract = {Arud is the metrical system used in classical Arabic poetry. This paper introduces a method based on an encoding of Arud for the automatic discrimination of authors. This measure was used for both Arabic and English texts in the domain of travel. Perfect classification, using hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward's method) and Burrows' Delta measure of inter-text distances, was obtained when using either the Arud-based encoding or the more common 100 most frequent words as the linguistic feature to represent the texts, and the text samples were of 1000 words in length. For shorter texts of 500 words, the Arudbased measure outperformed the baseline of the 100 most frequent words, as measured by the Rand Index. Both sets of features produced better clustering for the Arabic data set than the English data set for the shorter texts.},
