              is sufficiently probable that quantitative scansion in Latin, imposed on a language in which accentuation by stress was alone significant originally, not only gave way to the earlier principle in the decline of Latin literature, but scarcely tended to suppress it at any time in common speech and in familiar writing. It is also probable therefore that even in literature dominated by quantity stress-accentuation was not obliterated altogether. In fact the incidences of it, in Vergilian verse at least, seemed so characteristic that in late Antiquity the Vergilian stress-rhythms were apparently copied without any knowledge of the prosody of the hexameter. In modern expositions, the variety of Vergil's rhythms is generally referred, not only to scansion, but also to stress-accentuation: and it has recently been shown that lines in which stress and metrical ictus predominantly coincide are different in quality and expressiveness from lines in which they do not. Since however no general explanation or definition of this difference in quality seemed to have been offered, I lately attempted a simple theory which would account for the different aesthetic values of lines of these two classes, and which would define, if possible, what these different values are.},

These tests are performed using two separate feature sets: a ‘‘raw’’ feature set containing all words and word bigrams that are common to all of the authors, and a second ‘‘pre-processed’’ feature set derived by reducing the raw feature set to include only words meeting a minimum relative frequency threshold. Each of the methods tested performed well, but nearest shrunken centroids and regularized discriminant analysis had the best overall performances with 0/70 cross-validation errors.},

B 32 (1970) 350; Biometrics 26 (1970) 23)), generates distributions of differences in goodness-of-ﬁt expected under each of the competing models. In the data informed version of the PBCM, the generating models have speciﬁc parameter values obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data under consideration. The data informed difference distributions can be compared to the observed difference in goodness-of-ﬁt to allow a quantiﬁcation of model adequacy. In the data uninformed version of the PBCM, the generating models have a relatively broad range of parameter values based on prior knowledge. Application of both the data informed and the data uninformed PBCM is illustrated with several examples.},

This study is concerned with developing intelligent methods which can be used to distinguish poem from prose. The goal is to distinguish and extract effective poetic features with which poems/lyrics can be accurately classified from other type of texts. In this paper, we propose five different approaches to poem classification. In each approach, we extracted a different set of poetic features and evaluated their performances against each other. In addition, we empirically assessed the effectiveness of traditional text classification methods for poem recognition and compared it with the proposed poetic features. While all of these approaches performed well, some showed superior results. Findings of this study suggest that the proposed features generate highly accurate classifiers, which can be used for poem mining in large databases such as World Wide Web. 1.},

For shorter texts of 500 words, the Arudbased measure outperformed the baseline of the 100 most frequent words, as measured by the Rand Index. Both sets of features produced better clustering for the Arabic data set than the English data set for the shorter texts.},

Burrows as a tool in authorship attribution problems, particularly in large ‘open’ problems in which conventional methods of attribution are not able to limit the claimants effectively. This paper tests Delta’s effectiveness and accuracy, and shows that it works nearly as well on prose as it does on poetry. It also shows that much larger numbers of frequent words are even more accurate than the 150 that Burrows tested. Automated methods that allow for tests on large numbers of differently selected words show that removing personal pronouns and words for which a single text supplies most of the occurrences greatly increases the accuracy of Delta tests. Further tests suggest that large changes in Delta and Delta z-scores from the likeliest to the second likeliest author typically characterize correct attributions, that differences in point of view among the texts are more signiﬁcant than differences in nationality, and that combining several texts for each author in the primary set reduces the effect of intra-author variability. Although Delta occasionally produces errors in attribution with characteristics that would normally lead to a great deal of conﬁdence, the results presented here conﬁrm its usefulness in the preliminary stages of authorship attribution problems.},

My present objects, accordingly, are to give a more complete account of the procedure itself; to report the outcome of an extensive set of trials; and to consider the strengths and limitations of the new procedure. The procedure offers a simple but comparatively accurate addition to our current methods of distinguishing the most likely author of texts exceeding about 1,500 words in length. It is of even greater value as a method of reducing the ﬁeld of likely candidates for texts of as little as 100 words in length. Not unexpectedly, it works least well with texts of a genre uncharacteristic of their author and, in one case, with texts far separated in time across a long literary career. Its possible use for other classiﬁcatory tasks has not yet been investigated.},

We then provide an evaluation of these classifiers’ performance when used with the versification features found in Czech, German, Spanish, and English poetry. We conclude that versification is a reasonable stylometric marker, the strength of which is comparable to the other markers traditionally used in stylometry (such as the frequencies of the most frequent words and the frequencies of the most frequent character n-grams).},

	abstract = {The question of minimal sample size is one of the most important issues in stylometry and nontraditional authorship attribution. In the last decade or so, a few studies concerning different aspects of scalability in stylometry have been published (Zhao and Zobel, 2005; Hirst and Feiguina, 2007; Stamatatos, 2008; Koppel et al., 2009; Mikros, 2009; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2011), but the question has not been answered comprehensively. In his recent study, Eder proposed a systematic approach to solve the problem in a series of experiments, claiming that a sample should have at least 5,000 running words to be attributable (Eder, 2015). The above studies (and many other as well) tacitly assume that there exists a certain amount of linguistic data that allows for reliable authorial recognition, and the real problem at stake is to determine that very value. However, one can assume that the authorial fingerprint is not distributed evenly in a collection of texts. Just the contrary, many experiments seem to suggest that the authorial voice is sometimes overshadowed by other signals, such as genre, gender, chronology, or translation. Some authors, say Chandler, should be easily attributable, while some other authors, say Virginia Woolf, will probably have their fingerprint somewhat hidden. Moreover, authorship attribution is ultimately a matter of context: telling apart Hemingway and Dickens will always be easier than distinguishing the Bronte sisters. On theoretical grounds, then, the minimal sample size can not be determined once and forever for the entire corpus, but may be different for different texts in the corpus.},
