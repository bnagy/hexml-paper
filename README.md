NB: The commit messages about 'reviewer feedback' refer to internal institutional review, NOT academic peer review by the journal. This is a pre-print, and contains none of the revisions suggested by the journal reviewers. A link to the DOI for the post-print paper will appear here in due course.

Here is [the paper](the_paper.pdf).

Also included: a Jupyter notebook to reproduce all of the figures and tables in [repro/](repro). You will need to `pip install MQDQParser` before you can play along.

Finally, there's a short [research note](hexameter_stuff.pdf) about technical Latin hexameter stuff, which covers some of the rationale behind the code design for [MQDQParser](https://github.com/bnagy/mqdq-parser).
