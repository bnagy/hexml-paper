LaTeX and figures for the paper 'Metre as a stylometric feature for Latin hexameter poetry'.

This article has been accepted for publication in [Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](https://academic.oup.com/dsh), published by Oxford University Press. The DOI is 10.1093/llc/fqaa043. [This notebook](repro/fig_repro_dsh.ipynb) contains the repro information for the figures from the _revised_ article.

NB: The commit messages about 'reviewer feedback' refer to internal institutional review, NOT academic peer review by the journal. This is a pre-print, and contains none of the revisions suggested by the journal reviewers. The final article contains several changes to the classification methods and is generally better, so it should be preferred.

Here is [the preprint](the_paper.pdf).

Also included: a Jupyter notebook to reproduce all of the figures and tables in [repro/](repro). You will need to `pip install MQDQParser` before you can play along.

Finally, there's a short [research note](hexameter_stuff.pdf) about technical Latin hexameter stuff, which covers some of the rationale behind the code design for [MQDQParser](https://github.com/bnagy/mqdq-parser).
