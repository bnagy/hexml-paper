# hexml-paper

LaTeX and figures for the paper 'Metre as a stylometric feature for Latin hexameter poetry'.

Here is the actual [the_paper.pdf](paper).

Also included: a Jupyter notebook to reproduce all of the figures and tables in [repro/](repro). You will need to `pip install MQDQParser` before you can play along.

Finally, there's a short research note about technical Latin hexameter stuff, called [hexameter_stuff](hexameter_stuff.pdf) which covers some of the rationale behind the code design for [https://github.com/bnagy/mqdq-parser](MQDQParser).
