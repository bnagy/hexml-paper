# hexml-paper

LaTeX and figures for the paper 'Metre as a stylometric feature for Latin hexameter poetry'.

Here is [the paper](the_paper.pdf).

Also included: a Jupyter notebook to reproduce all of the figures and tables in [repro/](repro). You will need to `pip install MQDQParser` before you can play along.

Finally, there's a short [research note](hexameter_stuff.pdf) about technical Latin hexameter stuff, which covers some of the rationale behind the code design for [MQDQParser](https://github.com/bnagy/mqdq-parser).
